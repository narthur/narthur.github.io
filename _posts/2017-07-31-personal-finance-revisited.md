title:  "Personal Finance Revisited"
---

This is a summary of my current approach to personal finance after my first year
of living (somewhat) on my own.

# Philosophy: Your Money Or Your Life + Dave Ramsey

Before I graduated from college, I was already listening to Dave Ramsey quite a
bit, and I've continued to follow his philosophy, regardless of the fact I'm not
in debt.

Around last Christmas time I listened to an abridged / paraphrased version of
[Your Money Or Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766),
and have found the ideas it contains to be very useful. It can be summarized
briefly as giving the reader a plan to achieve financial independence (a kind of
early retirement) by revolutionizing the reader's fundamental relationship with
time, money, and possessions.

I highly recommend you [read the book](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766)
(I'm still planning to!). [Trent Hamm](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/review-your-money-or-your-life/)
and [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/12/18/your-money-or-your-life/)
have both put up great summaries of the book, too.

# Budgeting: You Need a Budget

Right out of college I started using [Simple](https://www.simple.com/) to do my
banking. The service tries to encourage banking by allowing you to define goals
you want to save for, and (optionally) how much you want the service to
automatically earmark towards that goal each day, thereby removing that money
from the balance the service tells you is safe for you to spend. Why not use
this feature to do my budgeting?

While this works fine in theory, in practice Simiple's budgeting tool is very
simplistic and not well-optimized for use with a complete budget. I quickly
outgrew the budgeting tools Simple had to offer (though I still love them as a
bank!).

After giving up on doing my budgeting inside Simple, I switched to using [Google
Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), cobbling together the extra
functionality I wanted using [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/).
This approach gave me the flexibility to revise my approach to budgeting over
time, figuring out what works and doesn't work for me along the way. However,
it was clunky and unwieldy.

Thankfully, after I had developed a fairly good idea of what I needed in a
budgeting tool, I discovered that the tool I needed already existed: [You Need
a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (YNAB). This tool does exactly what I
had discovered I needed via reinventing the wheel, and better. I've been using
YNAB to do all my budgeting for almost seven months now, and couldn't be more
satisfied.

Some of my favorite features:

- An emphasis on spending your money at least a month after you earn it.
- Flexible reporting.
- The ability to attach goals to your budget items. Tell it how much you need in
  a particular category, and by when, and it'll tell you how much you need to
  put in this month to make your goal.

You can find out more about how YNAB's software works at [their website](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

# Investing: Betterment

Near the end of college, I started investing using [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com/),
which allowed me to put some of my money into market with very little effort or
up-front capital. It was a great way to get into investing gingerly.

However, after graduating, I started having more money I wanted to invest, and
I wanted to be able to invest that money towards different goals, for which I'd
need the money at different times. This difference in time horizons for various
goals meant I really needed to have a different portfolio for each goal. Acorns
didn't let me do that. They only let you choose one portfolio for all the money
you invest with them.

That's why I was so happy when I started using [Betterment](http://betterment.com/).
Betterment does goal-based investing, meaning they allow you to set up multiple
"accounts" within your main Betterment account, each with a different financial
goal, time horizon, and, importantly portfolio make-up. Betterment also makes it
very easy to set up automatic withdrawals from your bank account, and lets you
know at a glance which goals are on-target, and which goals need attention to
make sure you stay on track to meeting your target on time.

Having read *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* before graduating, as well as
researching the investment strategies of people like [Trent Hamm](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/)
and [Alistair Huong](https://www.savingthecrumbs.com/), I was already quite
opinionated about the investing strategy I wanted to use. I was looking to
follow a passive buy-and-hold strategy with a highly diversified portfolio while
minimizing expenses. This is exactly the strategy that Betterment encourages.
