"Finally, brethren, ... whatsoever things are honest, ... think on these things" (Philippians 4:8).

## Translation

What did the translators understand _honesty_ to mean?

According to the [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=honesty), the word *honesty* originally had much more to do with nobility and propriety of behavior than it did with telling the truth as it does so narrowly now.

Other Bible translators seem to support the idea that this is what the KJV is trying to communicate with the word *honesty* in Philippians 4:8. Here are a few other versions of the Bible and how they translate the same word in this verse:

Version                            | Word Used
-----------------------------------|-----------
[New King James Version  ][nkjv]   | noble
[Young's Literal Translation][ylt] | grave
[English Standard Version ][esv]   | honorable
[American Standard Version ][asv]  | honorable
[New International Version ][niv]  | noble

[ylt]: http://www.biblestudytools.com/ylt/philippians/4-8.html
[esv]: http://www.biblestudytools.com/esv/philippians/4-8.html
[asv]: http://www.biblestudytools.com/asv/philippians/4-8.html
[niv]: http://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8.html

Dictionaries from closer to the King James Version's date of publication (1611) define *honesty* and related terms similarly. [Webster's 1828 dictionary abridged for the King James Version](http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-dictionary/kjv-dictionary-index.html) defines *honesty* [this way](http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-dictionary/honesty.html):

> In principle, an upright disposition; moral rectitude of heart; a disposition to conform to justice and correct moral principles, in all social transactions. In fact, upright conduct; an actual conformity to justice and moral rectitude.

[Page 86 of *The English dictionarie of 1623*](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89104407572;view=1up;seq=118) by Henry Cockeram defines the related word *honestate* as "To honor, to set forth."

## Verses Using the Same Word

[The Strong's Greek Definition for #4586, *semnov*,](http://www.apostolic-churches.net/bible/strongs/ref/?stgh=greek&stnm=4586) is as follows:

> 1) august, venerable, reverend
>
> 2) to be venerated for character, honourable
>
> 2a) of persons
>
> 2b) of deeds

There are [four verses](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&strongs=g4586) in the New Testament which contain this Greek word:

"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are **honest, G4586** whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things" (Philippians 4:8).

"Likewise must the deacons be **grave, G4586** not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;" (1 Timothy 3:8).

"Even so must their wives be **grave, G4586** not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things" (1 Timothy 3:11).

"That the aged men be sober, **grave, G4586** temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience" (Titus 2:2).

[The NKJV translates G4586](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=NKJV&strongs=g4586) as *noble* in Philippians 4:8 and *reverent* in the remaining three verses.
