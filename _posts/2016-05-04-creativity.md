Internet should be great at encouraging creativity, right?*

Contrary to popular opinion, creativity is not about reaching deep inside yourself to some
magical, incomprehensible place wherein lies the Fount of Novelty. Creativity is
about solving a problem which *already exists* by combining several other elements
which *already exist.*

For our purposes, creativity is not limited to super-artistic, right-brained,
subjective modern art. Creativity is anything a person can do that produces something that didn't exist before, from programming to architecture to entrepreneurship to [Life-Size Play-Doh Sculptures](http://www.odditycentral.com/pics/life-size-chevrolet-is-worlds-largest-play-doh-sculpture.html).

## Phases of Creativity

Creativity can be broken down into three activities:

1. Collection
2. Reflection
3. Creation

These activities may not be distinct, but all three must be present for
effective creativity.

### Collect

Collection is the process by which the creator gathers the raw materials that
will later be modified and combined in novel ways to form the final creation.

Expose yourself to many of interesting ideas, experiences, and information from
many widely-varying fields and disciplines.

When ever you notice a problem that should be fixed, write down the problem and give
yourself a few moments to think about possible ways it could be fixed. Write down these
ideas, too.

Whenever you have an idea, always, always, always write it down no matter how dumb it
sounds. Humans have a natural [Anti Creativity Bias](http://historysquared.com/2011/10/04/the-anti-creativity-behavioral-bias/).
A dumb-sounding idea may be the seed of future genius.

### Reflect

Reflection is the process by which the creator gives his or her mind time to
process the information he or she has gathered, assimilate it, and make
connections between different pieces. This process often takes time and can't
be rushed.

Give yourself plenty of relaxed time to think and process the information you have
collected.

### Create

At your leisure, mentally follow the paths your ideas present, writing down your
thoughts as you go. Whether or not the idea is "good" is irrelevant. Every idea you have
presents a valuable opportunity to develop the skills of [Divergent](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-divergent-thinking.htm)
and [Convergent Thinking](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-convergent-thinking.htm), two
important elements of the creative process.

Revisit your ideas at regular intervals. This will give your subconscious a chance to
process the information relating to the idea, giving you new insights each time you come
back to it. The time between each revisitation is commonly called the incubation stage
(see [Enhancing Creative Incubation](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/zig-zag/201304/enhancing-creative-incubation); and

## Architecting Personal Creativity

Theoretically, the Internet should be a huge boon to creativity. It's a network of every
type of information imaginable linked together in often surprising ways and accessible to
virtually anyone.

Unfortunately, the Internet has made many of us into [skimmers](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/)
and [compulsives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder), two behavior
patterns which, if left unchecked, can prevent the deep digestion of information required
for profound creativity.

Services such as Pocket and Instapaper offer a solution to this problem by allowing you to
easily save lots of information when skimming, and then go back and thoughtfully read that
information later. This means that skimming can actually work to your advantage by
allowing you to quickly gather large quantities of disparate information, which is one of
the prerequisites of creativity.

In summary, here are the things you should look for in a "read-it-later"-type service:

1. It allows you to save large amounts of information quickly for digestion at a later date.
2. It strips out distracting elements of the page, thereby making thoughtful reading easier.
3. It allows articles to be read offline. (Just the presence of an Internet connection can be a big distraction.)
4. It allows for easy saving of information for later search and retrieval.

Two contenders in this space are Instapaper and Pocket. I've never used
Instapaper, but [Lifehacker did do this thorough comparison of Pocket and
Instapaper back in 2013](http://lifehacker.com/5894995/bookmark-and-read-later-apps-compared-read-it-later-vs-instapaper-vs-readability).

Pocket has served the purpose well for me. It meets all my requirements for
encouraging creativity.

## My Pocket Workflow

Below I've outlined the workflow that I've found works best for breeding
creativity over time.

![Pocket Workflow](http://i1.wp.com/www.jamierubin.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pocket-Process.jpg?resize=550%2C412)

Evernote Clutter-Free](http://www.jamierubin.net/2014/01/14/going-paperless-my-process-for-keeping-evernote-clutter-free/)*

1. Browse the Internet, saving interesting articles to Pocket as I go using one
of their many browser extensions (such as the [Save to
Pocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj)
Chrome extension).
2. If I see a website I might want to subscribe to (more on that later), I'll save every
one of the articles on the first page to Pocket.
3. Sync Pocket on my laptop and my portable device at sporadic intervals as is
convenient.
4. At my leisure, read the articles (even if offline), often a couple right before going
to sleep.
5. Save any links in the articles I read to Pocket from within the Pocket interface
(allowing me to follow trails of information from article to article in a delightfully
relaxed manner).
6. If the article is worth keeping, star it before archiving it.
7. When I'm online and in the mood, go through all my starred articles saving them to
[Evernote](http://evernote.com/) and then unstarring them in Pocket. (Note: You could
create an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) recipe to do this, but you'd only
get the article's URL, not the full text.)
8. If (and only if) I find every article on a given website valuable, use
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to automatically save new articles from the
site's RSS feed into Pocket as they're published.
9. Process (tag and organize) the newly-saved articles in
[Evernote](http://evernote.com/), my outsourced, searchable memory.

One interesting addition to this list I've toyed around with is using an
Applescript to retrieve a random note from Evernote for review. This has two
potential benefits:

1. It provides the opportunity to iteratively improve my Evernote library by
giving me a chance to decide whether something should be re-tagged or deleted.
2. It has the potential to improve my working knowledge of what I have saved in
my library, improving both my access to said saved knowledge and my creativity
by making it more likely I'll be able to connect disparate pieces of
information. (See: [Spaced repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition);
[How Creativity Works, & How to Do It](http://zenhabits.net/creativity/))

Here's the AppleScript code:

```applescript
tell application "Evernote"
  set noteCount to count of (find notes "")
  set randomNote to random number from 1 to noteCount
  set myNote to item randomNote of (find notes "")
  open note window with myNote
  activate
end tell
```

In the past I've also kept an Evernote notebook dedicated to ideas where I
record all the ideas I ever have and revisit them as they regain my interest.
This may have even more value than the Pocket workflow, and is a practice that
has persisted even as I've moved away from using Evernote.
