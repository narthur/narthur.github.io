I'm going to answer this question with the assumption that the reason you want to save 
articles is so that you can enhance your creativity. (And by creativity, I do not mean 
only super-artistic, right-brained, subjective modern art. I mean anything a person can do 
that produces something that didn't exist before, from programming to architecture to 
entrepreneurship to [Life-Size Play-Doh Sculptures

Contrary to popular opinion, creativity is not about reaching deep inside yourself to some 
magical, incomprehensible place wherein lies the Fount of Novelty. What creativity is 
about is taking a problem which *already exists,* and combining several other elements 
which *already exist* into a solution for that problem. The steps to achieving creativity, 
then, become much more manageable:

1. Expose yourself to lots and lots of interesting ideas, experiences, and information 
from many widely-varying fields and disciplines.
2. Give yourself plenty of relaxed time to think and process that information.
3. When ever you notice a problem that should be fixed, write down the problem and give 
yourself a few moments to think about possible ways it could be fixed. Write down these 
ideas, too.
4. Whenever you have an idea, always, always, always write it down no matter how dumb it 
sounds. Humans have a natural [Anti Creativity Bias](http://historysquared.com/2011/10/04/the-anti-creativity-behavioral-bias/).
A dumb-sounding idea may be the seed of future genius.
5. At your leisure, mentally follow the path each idea presents, writing down your 
thoughts as you go. Whether or not the idea is "good" is irrelevant. Every idea you have 
presents a valuable opportunity to develop the skills of [Divergent](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-divergent-thinking.htm) 
and [Convergent Thinking](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-convergent-thinking.htm), two 
important elements of the creative process.
6. Revisit the idea at regular intervals. This will give your subconscious a chance to 
process the information relating to the idea, giving you new insights each time you come 
back to it. The time between each revisitation is commonly called the incubation stage 
(see [Enhancing Creative Incubation](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/zig-zag/201304/enhancing-creative-incubation); and

# Choosing Your Tool

Ok, so regarding your choice of tools:

Theoretically, the Internet should be a huge boon to creativity. It's a network of every 
type of information imaginable linked together in often surprising ways and accessible to 
virtually anyone.

Unfortunately, the Internet has made many of us into [skimmers](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/) 
and [compulsives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder), two behavior 
patterns which, if left unchecked, can prevent the deep digestion of information required 
for profound creativity.

Services such as Pocket and Instapaper offer a solution to this problem by allowing you to 
easily save lots of information when skimming, and then go back and thoughtfully read that 
information later. This means that skimming can actually work to your advantage by 
allowing you to quickly gather large quantities of disparate information, which is one of 
the prerequisites of creativity.

In summary, here are the things you should look for in a "read-it-later"-type service:

1. It allows you to save large amounts of information quickly for digestion at a later date.
2. It strips out distracting elements of the page, thereby making thoughtful reading easier.
3. It allows articles to be read offline. (Just the presence of an Internet connection can be a big distraction.)
4. It allows for easy saving of information for later search and retrieval.

You mention Kippt, Instapaper, and Pocket as contenders. 
[Kippt is dying](http://blog.kippt.com/2014/05/06/the-next-chapter/), so it's no longer a 
contender.

I've never used Instapaper so I don't feel qualified to make a judgment. However, 
[Lifehacker did do this thorough comparison of Pocket and Instapaper in September of last 
year](http://lifehacker.com/5894995/bookmark-and-read-later-apps-compared-read-it-later-vs-instapaper-vs-readability).

I absolutely adore Pocket. It meets all the requirements for encouraging creativity. 
Following is my workflow, which has been adapted over the years with creativity in mind.

# My Pocket Workflow

TLDR version:

![Pocket Workflow](http://i1.wp.com/www.jamierubin.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pocket-Process.jpg?resize=550%2C412)

(image credit due to this wonderful article: [Going Paperless: My Process for Keeping 
Evernote Clutter-Free](http://www.jamierubin.net/2014/01/14/going-paperless-my-process-for-keeping-evernote-clutter-free/))

Long & detailed version:

1. Browse the Internet, saving interesting articles to Pocket as I go using the Save to Pocket (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj) Chrome extension.
2. If I see a website I might want to subscribe to (more on that later), I'll save every one of the articles on the first page to Pocket.
3. Sync Pocket on my laptop and on my iPod Touch at sporadic intervals (read: whenever I feel like it).
4. At my leisure, read the articles (even if offline), often a couple right before going to sleep.
5. Save any links in the articles I read to Pocket right inside the Pocket interface (allowing me to follow trails of information from article to article in a delightfully relaxed manner).
6. If the article's worth keeping, star it before archiving it.
7. When I'm online (and feel like it), go through all my starred articles saving them to Evernote (http://evernote.com/) and then unstarring them in Pocket. Note: You could create an IFTTT (https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal) recipe to do this, but you'd only get the article's URL, not the full text.
8. If (and only if) I find every article on a given website interesting, use IFTTT (https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal) to automatically save every article from the site's RSS feed into Pocket as they're published.
9. Process (tag and organize) the newly-saved articles in Evernote (http://evernote.com/), my outsourced, searchable memory.
10. New to me, and something I'm very excited about: For the past few days I've been using an AppleScript to open a random note from my Evernote library for review. This has two benefits: First, it helps me iteratively improve my Evernote library by giving me a chance to decide whether something should be re-tagged or deleted, and second, it helps me improve my working knowledge of what I have saved in my library, improving both my access to said saved knowledge and my creativity by making it more likely I'll be able to connect disparate pieces of information. (See: Spaced repetition (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition); How Creativity Works, & How to Do It (http://zenhabits.net/creativity/))

Here's the AppleScript code:

```applescript
tell application "Evernote"
  set noteCount to count of (find notes "")
  set randomNote to random number from 1 to noteCount
  set myNote to item randomNote of (find notes "")
  open note window with myNote
  activate
end tell
```

Alongside my Pocket workflow, I also keep an Evernote notebook dedicated to ideas where I record all the ideas I ever have and revisit them as they regain my interest.

Whew. That was a long one. Hope you found something useful to your own workflow.
