I completed [How to Lead When You’re Not in Charge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33098700-how-to-lead-when-you-re-not-in-charge?from_search=true) 
by Clay Scroggins on June 18, 2018. The author shares biblical principles for how to lead even when no one’s given you 
permission to do so.

While reading this book I at times found it very difficult to get past the author’s style of speaking, and I’m sure this 
was made worse by the fact that I listened to it as [an audiobook read by the author](https://www.audible.com/pd/Business/How-to-Lead-When-Youre-Not-in-Charge-Audiobook/B01NBWW2H5). The lead pastor of the megachurch 
[North Point Community Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Point_Community_Church) in Alpharetta, Georgia, his 
youth-pastor-esque look-at-me-I’m-hip pop-culture references and verging-on-spoken-word-poetry speech rhythms often made 
me cringe.

From all that, you might assume I think you should skip this book. No, I don’t. I’m extremely glad I didn’t let his 
writing style stop me from finishing this listen. The book abounds with practical advice and profound insights on 
relating to your job in a Christ-like way and working towards lasting change in a sustainable and mature fashion. This 
book is anything but fluff.

I’ve already found this book to be helpful in my current job. Around the time I picked up this book, our organization 
had been going through a particularly stressful period due to a long-time coworker and great friend leaving the company. 
Reading this book helped me to be more effective in working with my employer and coworkers and continuing to make 
progress towards improving our products and processes in a way that didn’t create needless conflict.

It’s quite likely I’ll be reading this book again.

Buy this book if:

- You’re dissatisfied with your role in your organization. 
- You want to make a lasting difference through your work. 
- You have difficulty working with your employer. 
- You want to take on more leadership responsibility. 
- You prefer, or you at least don’t mind, reading material from an unashamedly Christian perspective.
