**What does God want for our thoughts?**

"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, ... think on these things" (Philippians 4:8).

**To what extent must we internalize the truth in order for our thoughts to be truthful?**

"Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts" (Psalm 51:6).

"Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:" (Proverbs 3:3).

**Do my thoughts have anything to do with my salvation?**

"Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that ... speaketh the truth in his heart" (Psalm 15:1-3).

**How can I bring my thoughts into harmony with the truth?**

"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:3-5).

"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17).

"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Hebrews 4:12).

*Note:* As I internalize God's Word, I give the Holy Spirit more and more power to transform my thought life into harmony with divine truth.
