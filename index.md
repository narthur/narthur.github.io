# Hello.

I'm Nathan.

My interests are varied, mostly relating to three key areas:

- Technology.
- Influence.
- Social change.

I feel most fulfilled when able to dedicate myself to developing technical systems that benefit society
while enabling individuals to learn and grow personally.

I believe a living faith and a personal connection with Christ have power to fulfill humanity's
fundamental needs. I know personally how profound the resulting change in the life is. I feel called to channel this 
healing power to those cut off from the Source, as friends did for me.

Go on, [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
