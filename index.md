# Hello.

My interests are varied, but tend to these:

- Technology.
- Influence.
- Social change.

I feel fulfilled developing technical systems that benefit society
and enable individuals to learn and grow personally.

I believe a living faith and a personal connection with Christ have power to fulfill humanity's
fundamental needs. I know personally how profound the resulting life change is. I feel called to channel this 
healing power to those cut off from the Source, as friends did for me.

They call me a minimalist, a programmer, and an introvert.

But you can just call me Nathan.

Go on, [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
