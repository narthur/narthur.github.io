# Summary

I've been using CSS since before I went to high school. Early on I had a passion
to learn how to create things using only CSS, whether people said it was
possible or not. Part of the reason for this was that I enjoyed the challenge
of pushing CSS to its limits, and part was that I simply hadn't yet learned 
JavaScript, so if I wanted a fancy recursive navigation system, I had to build 
it in pure CSS.

While in high school I requested [*CSS: The Ultimate Reference*](https://www.amazon.com/CSS-Ultimate-Reference-Tommy-Olsson/dp/0980285852) 
for a gift from my parents, and devoured it while riding in the back of a 
13-passenger van on the way to perform in a school hand bell concert.
