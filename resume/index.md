# Extended Bio

The intersection between technology and human cognition fascinates me. What can 
we learn from the brain that we can apply to technology? How does technology 
impact human behavior? How can we harness the power of technology to help people 
make positive changes in their lives? These are the questions that inspire me.

I was drawn to the Internet as a medium of communication before I left for 
academy. Just the idea that I could create something online that other people 
could see, my own website, was strangely compelling to me. At the age of 
fourteen I built my first website using Yahoo! GeoCities, and I was hooked. 
Since that day, I've never stopped building websites.

In the following years my interests grew to include the human mind and behavior. 
Through reading books and watching lectures, a curiosity as to the causes of 
behavioral addictions has enlarged to encompass neurology, psychology, and 
behavioral therapy, as well as how these topics interact with the world of 
technology and the Internet.

# Work Experience

    title="Technology Director" 
    organization="AudioVerse" 
    start=2019 
%}

I was responsible for all web and software development efforts in the
organization. I had one developer who answered to me, and in addition we
contracted out development and design work to two outside firms. I did
development work in React, Gatsby, and NextJS. I was also responsible for
maintaining our usage of AWS.

{%
    include organism_stint.html
    title="Contractor"
    organization="AudioVerse"
    start=2019
    end=2019

I worked as an independent contractor. During this time I developed a custom 
WordPress plugin and provided user interface designs for a custom dashboard.

{%
    include organism_stint.html
    title="Programmer"
    organization="SimpleUpdates"
    start=2016
    end=2019
%}

During my time at SimpleUpdates I developed features both on the front and 
backend of the company's custom CMS.

I was responisble for maintaining and developing the collection of themes 
available to users of the CMS. To aid in this I built and documented a component 
library that was shared between themes, allowing for the easier sharing of 
improvements between themes.

I also configured and maintained our CircleCI configuration in order to increase 
the speed of our GitHub workflow compared to the tool the company had previously 
used for its CI workflow. The new workflow used a docker container to 
encapuslate the needed project setup, both for CI and local development.
