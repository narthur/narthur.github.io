Hello.

My name is Nathan, and following is a little about myself:

I love learning. Over time my interests have converged within the intersection of technology, influence, and social
change. I feel the most fulfilled when I'm able to dedicate myself to developing technical systems that benefit society
while enabling individuals to learn, grow, and develop personally.

I believe passionately in the power of a living faith and personal connection with Christ to fulfill humanity's
fundamental needs. I know from personal experience what a profound impact the meeting of these needs can have on a
person's life. I feel strongly that it must be my mission to be a channel of this healing power to those who aren't in
a place to receive it from the Source, as many special people were to me when I felt shut off from God.

You may call me a minimalist, a programmer, or an introvert. But, mostly, I'd just like to be your friend.
